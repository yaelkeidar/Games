In the project, I implemented the game rock-paper-scissors in C.

At the beginning, the player is asked to choose how many rounds to play.
  
Then the player needs to choose a move (rock, paper or scissors).
  
The computer's move will be seen.
  
It's chosen randomly.
  
After knowing the computer's turn, we know who won the round.
  
The winner of the game is whoever won more rounds.
