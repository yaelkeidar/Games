In the project, I implemented the game sudoku in C.
The player is asked to choose whether to play against time or by difficulty level.


Against time-
The bord is 5X5 and the player has 60 seconds to solve it.
The player is asked to place a number on the board, then it's displayed as well as the time left.

Difficulty level-
There are 3 difficulty levels-
1. Easy- board of 4X4
2. Medium- board of 6X6
3. Hard- board of 9X9
In each level there are a few bords and the system randomly chooses one.
