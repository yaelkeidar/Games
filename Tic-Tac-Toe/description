In the project, I implemented the game tic-tac-toe in C.

At first, the player chooses if to play another player or against the computer.
Then they need to choose how many rounds to play.

The player enters a move and then it's the computer's turn (or the other player's turn).
They will play until there is a winner for the round, and game ends after playing all the rounds.
